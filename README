github-oauth-plugin:

The idea behind this plugin is that github already knows which users are committers on specific projects.

So we should be able to have an authentication process using OAuth that allows users to login to jenkins using their github credentials.

Nothing works yet but the plan is to use signpost-oauth or other example code to turn the login credentials into a user token.

Once we know the user is in github we want to let them trigger builds for projects that they have push access on.
