github-oauth-plugin:

The idea behind this plugin is that github already knows which users are committers on specific projects.

So we should be able to have an authentication process using OAuth that allows users to login to jenkins using their github credentials.

There are two key parts to this plugin:

A. GithubSecurityRealm: 

This handles the authentication and acquisition of the github oauth token for the connecting user.

This takes the client id and client secret from the application registration here: https://github.com/account/applications/new

The entry should look like this:

Main URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080
Callback URL: http://127.0.0.1:8080/securityRealm/finishLogin

With 127.0.0.1:8080 replaced with the hostname and port of your jenkins instance.


B. GithubAuthorizationStrategy:

This defines:

1. comma seperated list of users that should be given admin priviledges.

2. comma seperated list of organizations whose members should be given read and build permissions on the jobs.

3. check box to give other authenticated users read permission.

The plugin works but there are still some areas like form validation that need work.  And some other cases where exceptions are thrown when perhaps there is a better way.
